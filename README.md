# Coroutines Testing

This repo contains example code used to build my (Bill Phillips) talk on coroutines testing.

Use it however you please, but note some caveats here:

1. Molecule+turbine testing here is a bit hacked together. This is because Molecule's immediate clock support is very very fresh and didn't work for me here.
2. At the time of writing this, a version of Turbine with the tools I needed wasn't available. So they're copy-pasted into this repo.
